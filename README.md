# 202020
This is just a simple windows application which beeps after every 20 minutes.
It is made to help you follow 20-20-20 rule for keeping your eye health if your screen time is high.
20-20-20 Rule says to look far away from screen (e.g. 20 feets away) and blink your eyes 20 times in every 20 minutes.
Well windows defender is saying its a TrojanðŸ¥² so I have also uploaded c++ code of this application.
